**How much does your charitable donation actually cost you?**

If you're planning year-end giving, you may have seen calculators that say something like: "You're in the 24% bracket, so each dollar donated saves you 24 cents in taxes."

That approximation misses several important factors.

The real calculation is more complex:

→ You only benefit from the charitable deduction if your total itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction
→ Large donations can push you into lower tax brackets
→ State income taxes, SALT caps, and state-specific credits all interact with federal taxes
→ Benefits like the Child Tax Credit phase out based on AGI—donations can restore them
→ Charitable deductions are capped at 60% of AGI

**That's why we built GiveCalc.**

GiveCalc uses PolicyEngine's comprehensive tax model—the same open-source microsimulation used by congressional offices and think tanks—to calculate your actual tax savings from charitable giving.

Today we're launching **GiveCalc v2** with major improvements:

✅ Support for multiple income sources (wages, dividends, capital gains, self-employment)
✅ Multi-year tax planning (2024, 2025, or 2026)
✅ Transparency into all the federal and state charitable policies we model
✅ A faster, more responsive interface

**Try it free:** givecalc.org

No signup required. Works for all 50 states + DC + NYC.
