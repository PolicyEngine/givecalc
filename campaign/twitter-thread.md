Planning your Giving Tuesday donations?

Most calculators say "you're in the 24% bracket, so you save 24 cents per dollar."

That calculation misses several important factors.

GiveCalc uses a comprehensive tax model to calculate your actual savings.

We just shipped v2: givecalc.org

Why are simple calculators wrong?

5 factors they miss:

1. Standard vs. itemized threshold — you only benefit if itemized > standard deduction
2. Bracket changes — large donations push you into lower brackets
3. State taxes — SALT caps, state credits, deductions

4. Benefit phase-outs — donations can restore phased-out CTC, EITC
5. AGI limits — charitable deductions capped at 60% of AGI

GiveCalc models all of this for all 50 states + DC + NYC.

What's new in v2:

✅ Multiple income sources (wages, dividends, capital gains, etc.)
✅ Multi-year planning (2024, 2025, 2026) — including new OBBBA provisions
✅ See all federal & state charitable tax policies we model
✅ Faster, modern interface

For example: Arizona has 3 special charitable provisions:

• Tax credit up to $1,173/year
• Foster care credit
• 33% standard deduction boost

GiveCalc calculates all of these automatically.

The key metric: your "marginal giving discount"

This shows how much tax you save on your NEXT dollar of giving.

It changes as you donate more — often dropping when you exhaust itemized benefits or cross bracket thresholds.

**Marginal chart screenshot:** "Line chart showing marginal tax savings rate (y-axis, 0-40%) versus donation amount (x-axis). The line starts at 0%, jumps to about 32% once donations push itemized deductions above the standard deduction threshold, then gradually decreases as the donor moves into lower tax brackets."
