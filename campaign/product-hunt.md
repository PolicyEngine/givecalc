# Product Hunt Launch: GiveCalc

**Suggested launch day:** Sunday, December 1, 2024

## Product Details

**Name:** GiveCalc

**Tagline:** Calculate your true tax savings from charitable donations

**Description:**

GiveCalc uses a real tax model to calculate how charitable donations affect your taxes—not just a simple marginal rate estimate.

Most donation calculators say "you're in the 24% bracket, so you save 24 cents per dollar." But that misses:

• Standard vs. itemized deduction thresholds
• Tax bracket changes from large donations
• State income taxes and credits (50 states + DC + NYC)
• Benefit phase-outs (CTC, EITC)
• AGI-based deduction limits

GiveCalc models all of this using PolicyEngine's open-source microsimulation—the same model used by congressional researchers and think tanks.

**Key features:**

✅ Multiple income sources (wages, dividends, capital gains, self-employment)
✅ Multi-year tax planning (2024, 2025, 2026) — including new 2026 OBBBA provisions
✅ "Marginal giving discount" shows savings rate at each donation level
✅ All 50 states + DC + NYC
✅ Free, no signup, open source

**Pricing:** Free

**Categories:** Finance, Productivity, Tax

## First Comment (from Maker)

Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Max, ED of PolicyEngine. We build open-source tax and benefit models used by congressional offices and think tanks.

GiveCalc started at an EA hackathon in 2022 when I realized most donation calculators give inaccurate estimates. Your actual tax savings depend on more than your marginal rate.

Just shipped v2 with:
- Support for multiple income types (not just wages)
- Multi-year planning for 2024-2026
- Transparency into all the state-specific charitable provisions we model

Try it at givecalc.org and let me know what you think. Happy to answer any questions about the methodology.
