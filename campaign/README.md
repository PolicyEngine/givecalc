## Key Messages

### For Everyone
> Most donation calculators just multiply by your tax bracket. GiveCalc models the full tax code—standard vs. itemized thresholds, state taxes, benefit phase-outs, and more.

### For UK Donors
> Calculate your Gift Aid tax relief in seconds. See how higher rate relief, Scottish rates, and Personal Allowance tapering affect your true cost of giving.

### For EA/Optimizers
> Know your true cost of giving. GiveCalc shows your marginal savings rate at every donation level, helping you optimize your giving.

### For Tech/Open Source
> Built on PolicyEngine's open-source tax models—the same ones used by congressional offices. Fully transparent calculations.
