**This Giving Tuesday, know the true cost of your donation.**

We've launched GiveCalc (givecalc.org) — a free calculator that shows how charitable giving affects your taxes.

🇺🇸 **US donors**: See federal + state tax savings across all 50 states, DC, and NYC. Includes 2025 tax year with HR1 changes.

🇬🇧 **UK donors**: Calculate your Gift Aid tax relief, including Scottish income tax rates and Personal Allowance interactions.

Enter your income, filing status, and donation amount. GiveCalc shows your tax savings, marginal giving discount, and net cost.

Built on PolicyEngine's validated microsimulation models — the same infrastructure powering benefit screening tools that have identified over $1 billion in unclaimed benefits.
