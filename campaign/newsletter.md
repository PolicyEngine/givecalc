## Email Body

**Planning your year-end giving? Know your true cost.**

Most donation calculators give you a simple estimate: "You're in the 24% bracket, so you save 24 cents per dollar donated."

But that calculation misses several important factors.

**[GiveCalc](https://givecalc.org)** uses PolicyEngine's comprehensive tax model to calculate your actual tax savings from charitable giving. Today we're launching version 2 with major improvements:

### What's New

- **Multiple income sources** — Enter wages, dividends, capital gains, self-employment, and more
- **Multi-year planning** — Calculate for 2024, 2025, or 2026 tax years, including new OBBBA provisions for 2026
- **See all modeled policies** — Explore the federal and state charitable tax provisions we calculate
- **Faster, modern interface** — Rebuilt from the ground up with React

### Why It Matters

Simple calculators miss important factors:

1. **Standard vs. itemized threshold** — You only benefit if itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction
2. **Bracket changes** — Large donations can push you into lower brackets
3. **State tax interactions** — SALT caps, state credits, and deductions all interact
4. **Benefit phase-outs** — Donations can restore phased-out credits like the CTC and EITC
5. **AGI-based limits** — Charitable deductions are capped at 60% of AGI

GiveCalc models all of this across all 50 states, DC, and NYC.
