**Planning your year-end giving? Know your true cost.**

Most donation calculators give you a simple estimate: "You're in the 24% bracket, so you save 24 cents per dollar donated."

But that calculation misses several important factors.

**[GiveCalc](https://givecalc.org)** uses PolicyEngine's comprehensive tax models to calculate your actual tax savings from charitable giving. Today we're launching version 2 with major improvements:

### What's New

- **🇬🇧 UK Gift Aid support** — Calculate Gift Aid tax relief, including higher rate relief, Scottish income tax rates, and Personal Allowance interactions
- **🇺🇸 All 50 US states, plus DC and NYC** — Federal + state tax savings including 2025 HR1 changes
- **Multiple income sources** — Enter wages, dividends, capital gains, self-employment, and more
- **Multi-year planning (US)** — Calculate for 2024, 2025, or 2026 tax years

### Why It Matters

**For US donors**, simple calculators miss:
- Standard vs. itemized thresholds
- State tax interactions and SALT caps
- Benefit phase-outs (CTC, EITC)
- AGI-based limits (60% cap)

**For UK donors**, GiveCalc shows:
- Gift Aid relief the charity claims (25p per £1)
- Higher rate relief you claim back (40%/45% taxpayers)
- Scottish rate differences (19%-48%)
- Personal Allowance restoration (£100k+ earners)
